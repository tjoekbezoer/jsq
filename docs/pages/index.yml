  - title: Using jsq
    body: |
      
      Jsq allows you to mold your JSON data the way you want to. It does this
      through it's own query language, called *jsq*. A jsq query is made up of
      filters. A filter takes an input, and produces an output. Every filter is essentially
      a little program performing a certain task. There's plenty of built-in functionality
      that allows you to slice, filter, map, transform etc.
      
      Filters can be combined in various ways to up their power — you can pipe the output of
      one filter into another (like in UNIX), or collect the output of a filter
      into an array for example.
    
      Some filters produce multiple results, for instance there's one that
      produces all the elements of its input array. Piping that filter
      into a second runs the second filter for each element of the
      array. Generally, things that would be done with loops and iteration
      in other languages are just done by gluing filters together in jsq.

      It's important to remember that every filter has an input and an
      output. Even literals like "hello" or 42 are filters — they take an
      input but always produce the same literal as output. Operations that
      combine two filters, like addition, generally feed the same input to
      both and combine the results. So, you can implement an averaging
      filter as `add / length` — feeding the input array both to the `add`
      filter and the `length` filter and dividing the results.
      
      
      ## Calling jsq
          
      The jsq function is defined as follows:
      
      ```javascript
      var output = jsq( input..., query, iterator(value, key, output)?, context  ? )
      ```
      
      An arbitrary number of `input` objects can be passed (not required) after which a `query`
      string is expected. Finally an optional `iterator` function and calling `context` can be
      defined. Jsq always returns a results array, even when there's only a single or no results.
      
      The iterator function is called for every result. It's passed 3 arguments; the value of the
      result, the position of the result in the result array, and the complete result array. With
      the last argument, the iterator is able to manipulate the result array that's returned by jsq.
      
      
      ## Good to know
      
      Jsq tries to mimic JavaScript's behavior as much as possible, especially with regards to
      data types,  comparing values and logical operators. For example, `"1" == 1` will return
      true while `"1" === 1` will return false,  `2 && 0` will return 0, and `false || 2` will
      return 2.
      
      However, in some cases jsq's response will be different. `.foo = 2` will for instance not
      return the same as JavaScript's `foo = 2`. The latter will evaluate to 2, while jsq
      will return the entire object in which element '*foo*' now has value 2.
  
  - title: Basic filters
    entries:
      - title: "`.`"
        body: |
          
          The absolute simplest (and least interesting) filter
          is `.`. This is a filter that takes its input and
          produces it unchanged as output.

        examples:
          - program: '.'
            input: '"Hello, world!"'
            output: ['"Hello, world!"']

      - title: "`.foo`"
        body: |
          
          The simplest *useful* filter is .foo. When given a
          JSON object (aka dictionary or hash) as input, it produces
          the value at the key "foo", or nothing if there's none present.

        examples:
          - program: '.foo'
            input: '{"foo": 42, "bar": "less interesting data"}'
            output: '[42]'
          - program: '.foo'
            input: '{"notfoo": true, "alsonotfoo": false}'
            output: "['null']"

      - title: "`.[\"foo\"]`"
        body: |
          
          You can also look up fields of an object using syntax like
          `.["foo"]` (.foo above is a shorthand version of this). This
          one works for arrays as well, if the key is an
          integer. Arrays are zero-based (like javascript), so .[2]
          returns the third element of the array.

        examples:
          - program: '.[0]'
            input: '[{"name":"JSON", "good":true}, {"name":"XML", "good":false}]'
            output: ['{"name":"JSON", "good":true}']

          - program: '.[2]'
            input: '[{"name":"JSON", "good":true}, {"name":"XML", "good":false}]'
            output: ['null']

      - title: "`.[]`"
        body: |
          
          If you use the `.[foo]` syntax, but omit the index
          entirely, it will return *all* of the elements of an
          array. Running `.[]` with the input `[1,2,3]` will produce the
          numbers as three seperate results, rather than as a single
          array.

        examples:
          - program: '.[]'
            input: '[{"name":"JSON", "good":true}, {"name":"XML", "good":false}]'
            output:
              - '{"name":"JSON", "good":true}'
              - '{"name":"XML", "good":false}'

          - program: '.[]'
            input: '[]'
            output: []

      - title: "`,`"
        body: |
          
          If two filters are separated by a comma, then the
          input will be fed into both and there will be multiple
          outputs: first, all of the outputs produced by the left
          expression, and then all of the outputs produced by the
          right. For instance, filter `.foo, .bar`, produces
          both the "foo" fields and "bar" fields as separate outputs.

        examples:
          - program: '.foo, .bar'
            input: '{"foo": 42, "bar": "something else", "baz": true}'
            output: ['42', '"something else"']

          - program: ".user, .projects[]"
            input: '{"user":"tjoekbezoer", "projects": ["jsq", "wikiflow"]}'
            output: ['"tjoekbezoer"', '"jsq"', '"wikiflow"']
            
          - program: '.[4,2]'
            input: '["a","b","c","d","e"]'
            output: ['"e"', '"c"']
          
      - title: "`|`"
        body: |
          The | operator combines two filters by feeding the output(s) of
          the one on the left into the input of the one on the right. It's
          pretty much the same as the Unix shell's pipe, if you're used to
          that. 

          If the one on the left produces multiple results, the one on
          the right will be run for each of those results. So, the
          expression `.[] | .foo` retrieves the "foo" field of each
          element of the input array.

        examples:
          - program: '.[] | .name'
            input: '[{"name":"JSON", "good":true}, {"name":"XML", "good":false}]'
            output: ['"JSON"', '"XML"']

  - title: Types and Values
    body: |
      
      jsq supports the same set of datatypes as JSON - numbers,
      strings, booleans, arrays, objects, and "null".

      Booleans, null, strings and numbers are written the same way as
      in javascript. Just like everything else in jsq, these simple
      values take an input and produce an output - `42` is a valid jsq
      expression that takes an input, ignores it, and returns 42
      instead.

    entries:
      - title: Array construction - `[]`
        body: |
        
          As in JSON, `[]` is used to construct arrays, as in
          `[1,2,3]`. The elements of the arrays can be any jsq
          expression. All of the results produced by all of the
          expressions are collected into one big array. You can use it
          to construct an array out of a known quantity of values (as
          in `[.foo, .bar, .baz]`) or to "collect" all the results of a
          filter into an array (as in `[.items[].name]`)
        
          Once you understand the "," operator, you can look at jsq's array
          syntax in a different light: the expression [1,2,3] is not using a
          built-in syntax for comma-separated arrays, but is instead applying
          the `[]` operator (collect results) to the expression 1,2,3 (which
          produces three different results).

          If you have a filter `X` that produces four results,
          then the expression `[X]` will produce a single result, an
          array of four elements.

        examples:
          - program: "[.user, .projects[]]"
            input: '{"user":"tjoekbezoer", "projects": ["jsq", "wikiflow"]}'
            output: ['["tjoekbezoer", "jsq", "wikiflow"]']
      - title: Objects - `{}`
        body: |

          Like JSON, `{}` is for constructing objects (aka
          dictionaries or hashes), as in: `{"a": 42, "b": 17}`.
          
          If the keys are "sensible" (all alphabetic characters), then
          the quotes can be left off. The value can be any expression
          (although you may need to wrap it in parentheses if it's a
          complicated one), which gets applied to the {} expression's
          input (remember, all filters have an input and an
          output).
          
          ```jsq
          {foo: .bar}
          ```
          
          will produce the JSON object `{"foo": 42}` if given the JSON
          object `{"bar":42, "baz":43}`. You can use this to select
          particular fields of an object: if the input is an object
          with "user", "title", "id", and "content" fields and you
          just want "user" and "title", you can write
          
          ```jsq
          {user: .user, title: .title}
          ```
          
          Because that's so common, there's a shortcut syntax: `{user, title}`.
          
          If one of the expressions produces multiple results,
          multiple dictionaries will be produced. If the input's
          
          ```javascript
          {
            "user":"tjoekbezoer",
            "titles":["JSQ Primer", "More JSQ"]
          }
          ```
          
          then the expression
          
          ```jsq
          {user, title: .titles[]}
          ```
          
          will produce two outputs: 
          
          ```javascript
          [
            {"user":"tjoekbezoer", "title": "JSQ Primer"},
            {"user":"tjoekbezoer", "title": "More JSQ"}
          ]
          ```
          
          Putting parentheses around the key means it will be evaluated as an
          expression. With the same input as above,
          
          ```jsq
          {(.user): .titles}
          ```
          
          produces
          
          ```javascript
          {"tjoekbezoer": ["JSQ Primer", "More JSQ"]}
          ```
          
          Simple expressions, like a single filter, can also be used without the parentheses.
          
        examples:
          - program: '{user, title: .titles[]}'
            input: '{"user":"tjoekbezoer","titles":["JSQ Primer", "More JSQ"]}'
            output:
              - '{"user":"tjoekbezoer", "title": "JSQ Primer"}'
              - '{"user":"tjoekbezoer", "title": "More JSQ"}'
          - program: '{(.user): .titles}'
            input: '{"user":"tjoekbezoer","titles":["JSQ Primer", "More JSQ"]}'
            output: ['{"tjoekbezoer": ["JSQ Primer", "More JSQ"]}']

  - title: Builtin operators and functions
    body: |

      Some jsq operator (for instance, `+`) do different things
      depending on the type of their arguments (arrays, numbers,
      etc.). However, jsq never does implicit type conversions. If you
      try to add a string to an object you'll get an error message and
      no result.
      
    entries:
      - title: Addition - `+`
        body: |

          The operator `+` takes two filters, applies them both
          to the same input, and adds the results together. What
          "adding" means depends on the types involved:

          - **Numbers** are added by normal arithmetic.

          - **Arrays** are added by being concatenated into a larger array.

          - **Strings** are added by being joined into a larger string.
          
          - **Objects** are added by merging, that is, inserting all
              the key-value pairs from both objects into a single
              combined object. If both objects contain a value for the
              same key, the object on the right of the `+` wins.
          
          `null` can be added to any value, and returns the other
          value unchanged.

        examples:
          - program: '.a + 1'
            input: '{"a": 7}'
            output: ['8']
          - program: '.a + .b'
            input: '{"a": [1,2], "b": [3,4]}'
            output: ['[1,2,3,4]']
          - program: '.a + null'
            input: '{"a": 1}'
            output: ['1']
          - program: '.a + 1'
            input: '{}'
            output: ['1']
          - program: '{a: 1} + {b: 2} + {c: 3} + {a: 42}'
            input: 'null'
            output: ['{"a": 42, "b": 2, "c": 3}']

      - title: Subtraction - `-`
        body: |

          As well as normal arithmetic subtraction on numbers, the `-`
          operator can be used on arrays to remove all occurences of
          the second array's elements from the first array.

        examples:
          - program: '4 - .a'
            input: '{"a":3}'
            output: ['1']
          - program: . - ["xml", "yaml"]
            input: '["xml", "yaml", "json"]'
            output: ['["json"]']

      - title: Multiplication, division - `*` and `/`
        body: |

          These operators only work on numbers, and do the expected.

        examples:
          - program: '10 / . * 3'
            input: 5
            output: [6]
      
      - title: "`length`"
        body: |

          The builtin function `length` gets the length of various
          different types of value:

          - The length of a **string** is the number of Unicode
            codepoints it contains (which will be the same as its
            JSON-encoded length in bytes if it's pure ASCII).

          - The length of an **array** is the number of elements.

          - The length of an **object** is the number of key-value pairs.

          - The length of **null** is zero.

        examples:
          - program: '.[] | length'
            input: '[[1,2], "string", {"a":2}, null]'
            output: [2, 6, 1, 0]

      - title: "`keys`"
        body: |
          
          The builtin function `keys`, when given an object, returns
          its keys in an array.

          The keys are sorted "alphabetically", by unicode codepoint
          order. This is not an order that makes particular sense in
          any particular language, but you can count on it being the
          same for any two objects with the same set of keys,
          regardless of locale settings.

          When `keys` is given an array, it returns the valid indices
          for that array: the integers from 0 to length-1.

        examples:
          - program: 'keys'
            input: '{"abc": 1, "abcd": 2, "Foo": 3}'
            output: ['["Foo", "abc", "abcd"]']
          - program: 'keys'
            input: '[42,3,35]'
            output: ['[0,1,2]']

      - title: "`select`"
        body: |
          
          The function `select(foo)` produces its input unchanged if
          `foo` returns true for that input, and produces no output
          otherwise.

          It's useful for filtering lists: `[1,2,3] | map(select(. >= 2))`
          will give you `[2,3]`.

        examples:
          - program: 'map(select(. >= 2))'
            input: '[1,5,3,0,7]'
            output: ['[5,3,7]']

      - title: "`empty`"
        body: |
          
          `empty` returns no results. None at all. Not even `null`.

          It's useful on occasion. You'll know if you need it :)

        examples:
          - program: '1, empty, 2'
            input: 'null'
            output: [1, 2]
          - program: '[1,2,empty,3]'
            input: 'null'
            output: ['[1,2,3]']

      - title: "`map(x)`"
        body: |

          For any filter `x`, `map(x)` will run that filter for each
          element of the input array, and produce the outputs a new
          array. `map(.+1)` will increment each element of an array of numbers.

          `map(x)` is equivalent to `[.[] | x]`. In fact, this is how
          it's defined.

        examples:
          - program: 'map(.+1)'
            input: '[1,2,3]'
            output: ['[2,3,4]']

      - title: "`add`"
        body: |

          The filter `add` takes as input an array, and produces as
          output the elements of the array added together. This might
          mean summed, concatenated or merged depending on the types
          of the elements of the input array - the rules are the same
          as those for the `+` operator (described above).

          If the input is an empty array, `add` returns `null`.

        examples:
          - program: add
            input: '["a","b","c"]'
            output: ['"abc"']
          - program: add
            input: '[1, 2, 3]'
            output: [6]
          - program: add

            output: ["null"]
            
      # - title: "`sort`, `sort_by`"
      #   body: |
          
      #     The `sort` functions sorts its input, which must be an
      #     array. Values are sorted in the following order:

      #     * `null`
      #     * `false`
      #     * `true`
      #     * numbers
      #     * strings, in alphabetical order (by unicode codepoint value)
      #     * arrays, in lexical order
      #     * objects

      #     The ordering for objects is a little complex: first they're
      #     compared by comparing their sets of keys (as arrays in
      #     sorted order), and if their keys are equal then the values
      #     are compared key by key.

      #     `sort_by` may be used to sort by a particular field of an
      #     object, or by applying any jsq filter. `sort_by(foo)`
      #     compares two elements by comparing the result of `foo` on
      #     each element.

      #   examples:
      #     - program: 'sort'
      #       input: '[8,3,null,6]'
      #       output: ['[null,3,6,8]']
      #     - program: 'sort_by(.foo)'
      #       input: '[{"foo":4, "bar":10}, {"foo":3, "bar":100}, {"foo":2, "bar":1}]'
      #       output: ['[{"foo":2, "bar":1}, {"foo":3, "bar":100}, {"foo":4, "bar":10}]']

      # - title: "`group_by`"
      #   body: |
          
      #     `group_by(.foo)` takes as input an array, groups the
      #     elements having the same `.foo` field into separate arrays,
      #     and produces all of these arrays as elements of a larger
      #     array, sorted by the value of the `.foo` field.

      #     Any jsq expression, not just a field access, may be used in
      #     place of `.foo`. The sorting order is the same as described
      #     in the `sort` function above.

      #   examples:
      #     - program: 'group_by(.foo)'
      #       input: '[{"foo":1, "bar":10}, {"foo":3, "bar":100}, {"foo":1, "bar":1}]'
      #       output: ['[[{"foo":1, "bar":10}, {"foo":1, "bar":1}], [{"foo":3, "bar":100}]]']

      - title: "`min`, `max`"
        body: |
          
          Find the minimum or maximum element of the input array. The
          `_by` versions allow you to specify a particular field or
          property to examine, e.g. `min_by(.foo)` finds the object
          with the smallest `foo` field.

        examples:
          - program: 'min'
            input: '[5,4,2,7]'
            output: ['2']
          - program: 'max_by(.foo)'
            input: '[{"foo":1, "bar":14}, {"foo":2, "bar":3}]'
            output: ['{"foo":2, "bar":3}']

      # - title: "`unique`"
      #   body: |
          
      #     The `unique` function takes as input an array and produces
      #     an array of the same elements, in sorted order, with
      #     duplicates removed.

      #   examples:
      #     - program: 'unique'
      #       input: '[1,2,5,3,5,3,1,3]'
      #       output: ['[1,2,3,5]']

      - title: "`recurse`"
        body: |
          
          The `recurse` function allows you to search through a
          recursive structure, and extract interesting data from all
          levels. Suppose your input represents a filesystem:

          ```javascript
          {"name": "/", "children": [
            {"name": "/bin", "children": [
              {"name": "/bin/ls", "children": []},
              {"name": "/bin/sh", "children": []}
            ]},
            {"name": "/home", "children": [
              {"name": "/home/daan", "children": [
                {"name": "/home/daan/jsq", "children": []}
              ]}
            ]}
          ]}
          ```
          
          Now suppose you want to extract all of the filenames
          present. You need to retrieve `.name`, `.children[].name`,
          `.children[].children[].name`, and so on. You can do this
          with:

          ```jsq
          recurse(.children[]) | .name
          ```

        examples:
          - program: 'recurse(.foo[])'
            input: '{"foo":[{"foo": []}, {"foo":[{"foo":[]}]}]}'
            output: 
              - '{"foo":[{"foo":[]},{"foo":[{"foo":[]}]}]}'
              - '{"foo":[]}'
              - '{"foo":[{"foo":[]}]}'
              - '{"foo":[]}'

  - title: Conditionals and Comparisons
    entries:
      - title: "`==`, `===`, `!=`"
        body: |

          The expression 'a == b' will produce 'true' if the result of a and b
          are equal (that is, if they represent equivalent JSON documents) and
          'false' otherwise. In particular, strings are never considered equal
          to numbers. If you're coming from Javascript, jsq's == is like
          Javascript's === - considering values equal only when they have the
          same type as well as the same value.
          
          != is "not equal", and 'a != b' returns the opposite value of 'a == b'

        examples:
          - program: '.[] == 1'
            input: '[1, 1.0, "1", "banana"]'
            output: ['true', 'true', 'false', 'false']
      
      - title: "`>`, `>=`, `<=`, `<`"
        body: |
          
          The comparison operators `>`, `>=`, `<=`, `<` return whether
          their left argument is greater than, greater than or equal
          to, less than or equal to or less than their right argument
          (respectively).

          The ordering is the same as that described for `sort`, above.

        examples:
          - program: '. < 5'
            input: 2
            output: ['true']
      
      - title: if(cond, then[, else])
        body: |

          `if(A, B, C)` will execute `B` if `A` evaluates as truthy, otherwise it will optionally
          execute `C`.
          
          Checking for false or null is a simpler notion of
          "truthiness" than is found in Javascript or Python, but it
          means that you'll sometimes have to be more explicit about
          the condition you want: you can't test whether, e.g. a
          string is empty using `if .name then A else B end`, you'll
          need something more like `if (.name | count) > 0 then A else
          B end` instead.
          
          If the condition A produces multiple results, it is
          considered "true" if any of those results is not false or
          null. If it produces zero results, it's considered false.
          
          More cases can be added to an if using `elif A then B` syntax.

        examples:
          - program: |-
              if . == 0 then
                "zero"
              elif . == 1 then
                "one"
              else
                "many"
              end
            input: 2
            output: ['"many"']
      
      - title: "`&&`, `||`"
        body: |

          jsq supports the normal Boolean operators and/or/not. They have the
          same standard of truth as if expressions - false and null are
          considered "false values", and anything else is a "true value".

          If an operand of one of these operators produces multiple
          results, the operator itself will produce a result for each input.

          `not` is in fact a builtin function rather than an operator,
          so it is called as a filter to which things can be piped
          rather than with special syntax, as in `.foo and .bar |
          not`.
          
          These three only produce the values "true" and "false", and
          so are only useful for genuine Boolean operations, rather
          than the common Perl/Python/Ruby idiom of
          "value_that_may_be_null or default". If you want to use this
          form of "or", picking between two values rather than
          evaluating a condition, see the "//" operator below.
          
        examples:
          - program: '42 and "a string"'
            input: 'null'
            output: ['true']
          - program: '(true, false) or false'
            input: 'null'
            output: ['true', 'false']
          - program: '(true, false) and (true, false)'
            input: 'null'
            output: ['true', 'false', 'false', 'false']
          - program: '[true, false | not]'
            input: 'null'
            output: ['[false, true]']
  
  - title: Advanced features
    body: |
      Variables are an absolute necessity in most programming languages, but
      they're relegated to an "advanced feature" in jsq.

      In most languages, variables are the only means of passing around
      data. If you calculate a value, and you want to use it more than once,
      you'll need to store it in a variable. To pass a value to another part
      of the program, you'll need that part of the program to define a
      variable (as a function parameter, object member, or whatever) in
      which to place the data.

    # Finally, jsq has a `fold` operation, which is very powerful but a
    # bit tricky. Again, it's mostly used internally, to define some
    # useful bits of jsq's standard library.

    entries:
      - title: Variables
        body: |
          
          In jsq, all filters have an input and an output, so manual
          plumbing is not necessary to pass a value from one part of a program
          to the next. Many expressions, for instance `a + b`, pass their input
          to two distinct subexpressions (here `a` and `b` are both passed the
          same input), so variables aren't usually necessary in order to use a
          value twice.
          
          For instance, calculating the average value of an array of numbers
          requires a few variables in most languages - at least one to hold the
          array, perhaps one for each element or for a loop counter. In jsq, it's
          simply `add / length` - the `add` expression is given the array and
          produces its sum, and the `length` expression is given the array and
          produces its length.
          
          So, there's generally a cleaner way to solve most problems in jsq that
          defining variables. Still, sometimes they do make things easier, so jsq
          lets you define variables using `expression as $variable`. All
          variable names start with `$`. Here's a slightly uglier version of the
          array-averaging example:
          
          ```jsq
          length as $array_length | add / $array_length
          ```
          
          We'll need a more complicated problem to find a situation where using
          variables actually makes our lives easier.
          
          
          Suppose we have an array of blog posts, with "author" and "title"
          fields, and another object which is used to map author usernames to
          real names. Our input looks like:
          
          ```javascript
          {
            "posts": [
              {"title": "Frist psot", "author": "anon"},
              {"title": "A well-written article", "author": "person1"}],
            "realnames": {
              "anon": "Anonymous Coward",
              "person1": "Person McPherson"
            }
          }
          ```
          
          We want to produce the posts with the author field containing a real
          name, as in:
          
          ```javascript
          [
            {"title": "Frist psot", "author": "Anonymous Coward"},
            {"title": "A well-written article", "author": "Person McPherson"}
          ]
          ```
          
          We use a variable, $names, to store the realnames object, so that we
          can refer to it later when looking up author usernames:
          
          ```jsq
          .realnames as $names | .posts[] | {title, author: $names[.author]}
          ```
          
          The expression "foo as $x" runs foo, puts the result in $x,
          and returns the original input. Apart from the side-effect
          of binding the variable, it has the same effect as ".".

        examples:
          - program: '.bar as $x | .foo | . + $x'
            input: '{"foo":10, "bar":200}'
            output: ['210']

      # - title: Fold
      #   body: |
        
      #     The `fold` syntax in jsq allows you to combine all of the
      #     results of an expression by accumulating them into a single
      #     answer. As an example, we'll pass `[3,2,1]` to this expression:

      #     ```jsq
      #     fold 0 as $sum (.[] | $sum + .)
      #     ```
          
      #     The variable `$sum` is first given the value `0`. The body
      #     of the fold (i.e. `.[] | $sum + .`) is evaluated. `.[]`
      #     produces three results, `3`, `2`, and `1`. For the first
      #     one, `$sum + .` gives `3`.

      #     Having produced this answer, jsq backtracks to find the next
      #     result as per usual. However, this time, `$sum` is set to
      #     the previous value of the body, so `$sum + .` gives
      #     `5`. After the final backtracking, `$sum + .` gives
      #     `6`. This final value is used as the value of the entire
      #     `fold` expression, so the above filter returns `6`.

      #     More formally, in order to evaluate `fold INIT as $VAR
      #     (BODY)`, jsq first sets `$VAR` to the value of `INIT`. It
      #     then runs through `BODY`. Each time `BODY` produces a value,
      #     `$VAR` is set to that value and jsq backtracks to find the
      #     next one. When `BODY` stops producing values, the final
      #     value of `$VAR` is the result of the entire expression.

      #   examples:
      #     - program: 'fold 0 as $sum (.[] | $sum + .)'
      #       input: '[10,2,5,3]'
      #       output: ['20']
      

  - title: Assignment
    body: |

      Assignment works a little differently in jsq than in most
      programming languages. jsq doesn't distinguish between references
      to and copies of something - two objects or arrays are either
      equal or not equal, without any further notion of being "the
      same object" or "not the same object".

      If an object has two fields which are arrays, `.foo` and `.bar`,
      and you append something to `.foo`, then `.bar` will not get
      bigger. Even if you've just set `.bar = .foo`. If you're used to
      programming in languages like Python, Java, Ruby, Javascript,
      etc. then you can think of it as though jsq does a full deep copy
      of every object before it does the assignment (for performance,
      it doesn't actually do that, but that's the general idea).

    entries:
      - title: "`=`"
        body: |
          
          The filter `.foo = 1` will take as input an object
          and produce as output an object with the "foo" field set to
          1. There is no notion of "modifying" or "changing" something
          in jsq - all jsq values are immutable. For instance,
          
          ```jsq
          .foo = .bar | .foo.baz = 1
          ```
          
          will not have the side-effect of setting .bar.baz to be set
          to 1, as the similar-looking program in Javascript, Python,
          Ruby or other languages would. Unlike these languages (but
          like Haskell and some other functional languages), there is
          no notion of two arrays or objects being "the same array" or
          "the same object". They can be equal, or not equal, but if
          we change one of them in no circumstances will the other
          change behind our backs.
          
          This means that it's impossible to build circular values in
          jsq (such as an array whose first element is itself). This is
          quite intentional, and ensures that anything a jsq program
          can produce can be represented in JSON.

      - title: "`|=`"
        body: |
          As well as the assignment operator '=', jsq provides the "update"
          operator '|=', which takes a filter on the right-hand side and
          works out the new value for the property being assigned to by running
          the old value through this expression. For instance, .foo |= .+1 will
          build an object with the "foo" field set to the input's "foo" plus 1.
          
          This example should show the difference between '=' and '|='. Provide input
          
          ```javascript
          {"a": {"b": 10}, "b": 20}
          ```
          
          to the programs `.a = .b` and `.a |= .b`
          
          The former will set the "a" field of the input to the "b" field of the
          input, and produce the output {"a": 20}. The latter will set the "a"
          field of the input to the "a" field's "b" field, producing {"a": 10}.

      - title: "`+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`"
        body: |

          jsq has a few operators of the form `a op= b`, which are all
          equivalent to `a |= . op b`. So, `+= 1` can be used to increment values.

        examples:
          - program: .foo += 1
            input: '{"foo": 42}'
            output: ['{"foo": 43}']
      
      - title: Complex assignments
        body: |
          Lots more things are allowed on the left-hand side of a jsq assignment
          than in most langauges. We've already seen simple field accesses on
          the left hand side, and it's no surprise that array accesses work just
          as well:
          
          ```jsq
          .posts[0].title = "JSQ Manual"
          ```
          
          What may come as a surprise is that the expression on the left may
          produce multiple results, referring to different points in the input
          document:
          
          ```jsq
          .posts[].comments |= . + ["this is great"]
          ```
          
          That example appends the string "this is great" to the "comments"
          array of each post in the input (where the input is an object with a
          field "posts" which is an array of posts).
          
          When jsq encounters an assignment like 'a = b', it records the "path"
          taken to select a part of the input document while executing a. This
          path is then used to find which part of the input to change while
          executing the assignment. Any filter may be used on the
          left-hand side of an equals - whichever paths it selects from the
          input will be where the assignment is performed.
          
          This is a very powerful operation. Suppose we wanted to add a comment
          to blog posts, using the same "blog" input above. This time, we only
          want to comment on the posts written by "tjoekbezoer". We can find those
          posts using the "select" function described earlier:
          
          ```jsq
          .posts[] | select(.author == "tjoekbezoer")
          ```
          
          The paths provided by this operation point to each of the posts that
          "tjoekbezoer" wrote, and we can comment on each of them in the same way
          that we did before:
          
          ```jsq
          (.posts[] | select(.author == "tjoekbezoer") | .comments) |= . + ["terrible."]
          ```
