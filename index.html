			<h2><p>Using jsq</p>
</h2>
			<p>Jsq allows you to mold your JSON data the way you want to. It does this
through it&#39;s own query language, called <em>jsq</em>. A jsq query is made up of
filters. A filter takes an input, and produces an output. Every filter is essentially
a little program performing a certain task. There&#39;s plenty of built-in functionality
that allows you to slice, filter, map, transform etc.</p>
<p>Filters can be combined in various ways to up their power — you can pipe the output of
one filter into another (like in UNIX), or collect the output of a filter
into an array for example.</p>
<p>Some filters produce multiple results, for instance there&#39;s one that
produces all the elements of its input array. Piping that filter
into a second runs the second filter for each element of the
array. Generally, things that would be done with loops and iteration
in other languages are just done by gluing filters together in jsq.</p>
<p>It&#39;s important to remember that every filter has an input and an
output. Even literals like &quot;hello&quot; or 42 are filters — they take an
input but always produce the same literal as output. Operations that
combine two filters, like addition, generally feed the same input to
both and combine the results. So, you can implement an averaging
filter as <code>add / length</code> — feeding the input array both to the <code>add</code>
filter and the <code>length</code> filter and dividing the results.</p>
<h2>Calling jsq</h2>
<p>The jsq function is defined as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">var output = jsq( input..., query, iterator(value, key, output)?, context  ? )</code></pre>
<p>An arbitrary number of <code>input</code> objects can be passed (not required) after which a <code>query</code>
string is expected. Finally an optional <code>iterator</code> function and calling <code>context</code> can be
defined. Jsq always returns a results array, even when there&#39;s only a single or no results.</p>
<p>The iterator function is called for every result. It&#39;s passed 3 arguments; the value of the
result, the position of the result in the result array, and the complete result array. With
the last argument, the iterator is able to manipulate the result array that&#39;s returned by jsq.</p>
<h2>Good to know</h2>
<p>Jsq tries to mimic JavaScript&#39;s behavior as much as possible, especially with regards to
data types,  comparing values and logical operators. For example, <code>&quot;1&quot; == 1</code> will return
true while <code>&quot;1&quot; === 1</code> will return false,  <code>2 &amp;&amp; 0</code> will return 0, and <code>false || 2</code> will
return 2.</p>
<p>However, in some cases jsq&#39;s response will be different. <code>.foo = 2</code> will for instance not
return the same as JavaScript&#39;s <code>foo = 2</code>. The latter will evaluate to 2, while jsq
will return the entire object in which element &#39;<em>foo</em>&#39; now has value 2.</p>

			<h2><p>Basic filters</p>
</h2>
			
			
			<div>
				<h3><p><code>.</code></p>
</h3>
				<p>The absolute simplest (and least interesting) filter
is <code>.</code>. This is a filter that takes its input and
produces it unchanged as output.</p>

			</div>
			<div>
				<h3><p><code>.foo</code></p>
</h3>
				<p>The simplest <em>useful</em> filter is .foo. When given a
JSON object (aka dictionary or hash) as input, it produces
the value at the key &quot;foo&quot;, or nothing if there&#39;s none present.</p>

			</div>
			<div>
				<h3><p><code>.[&quot;foo&quot;]</code></p>
</h3>
				<p>You can also look up fields of an object using syntax like
<code>.[&quot;foo&quot;]</code> (.foo above is a shorthand version of this). This
one works for arrays as well, if the key is an
integer. Arrays are zero-based (like javascript), so .[2]
returns the third element of the array.</p>

			</div>
			<div>
				<h3><p><code>.[]</code></p>
</h3>
				<p>If you use the <code>.[foo]</code> syntax, but omit the index
entirely, it will return <em>all</em> of the elements of an
array. Running <code>.[]</code> with the input <code>[1,2,3]</code> will produce the
numbers as three seperate results, rather than as a single
array.</p>

			</div>
			<div>
				<h3><p><code>,</code></p>
</h3>
				<p>If two filters are separated by a comma, then the input will be fed into both and
there will be multiple outputs: first, all of the outputs produced by the left
expression, and then all of the outputs produced by the right. For instance, filter
<code>.foo, .bar</code>, produces both the &quot;foo&quot; fields and &quot;bar&quot; fields as separate outputs.</p>
<p>By combining expression like this, you are creating what is called a <em>list</em>. You can
read more about this in the next chapter <strong>Types and Values</strong>.</p>

			</div>
			<div>
				<h3><p><code>|</code></p>
</h3>
				<p>The | operator combines two filters by feeding the result(s) of
the one on the left into the input of the one on the right. It&#39;s
pretty much the same as the Unix shell&#39;s pipe, if you&#39;re used to
that. </p>
<p>If the one on the left produces multiple results, the one on
the right will be run for each of those results. So, the
expression <code>.[] | .foo</code> retrieves the &quot;foo&quot; field of each
element of the input array.</p>

			</div>

			<h2><p>Types and Values</p>
</h2>
			<p>jsq supports the same set of datatypes as JSON - numbers,
strings, booleans, arrays, objects, and &quot;null&quot;.</p>
<p>Booleans, null, strings and numbers are written the same way as
in javascript. Just like everything else in jsq, these simple
values take an input and produce an output - <code>42</code> is a valid jsq
expression that takes an input, ignores it, and returns 42
instead.</p>

			
			<div>
				<h3><p>Arrays — <code>[]</code></p>
</h3>
				<p>As in JSON, <code>[]</code> is used to construct arrays, as in
<code>[1,2,3]</code>. The elements of the arrays can be any jsq
expression. All of the results produced by all of the
expressions are collected into one big array. You can use it
to construct an array out of a known quantity of values (as
in <code>[.foo, .bar, .baz]</code>) or to &quot;collect&quot; all the results of a
filter into an array (as in <code>[.items[].name]</code>)</p>
<p>If you have a filter <code>X</code> that produces four results,
then the expression <code>[X]</code> will produce a single result, an
array of four elements.</p>

			</div>
			<div>
				<h3><p>Lists — <code>1,2,3</code></p>
</h3>
				<p>Once you understand the <code>,</code> operator, you can look at jsq&#39;s array
syntax in a different light: the expression <code>[1,2,3]</code> is not using a
built-in syntax for comma-separated arrays, but is actually applying
the <code>[]</code> operator (collect results) to the expression <code>1,2,3</code> which
produces a list of 3 integers.</p>
<p>A list will produce as many results as it has elements.</p>

			</div>
			<div>
				<h3><p>Objects — <code>{}</code></p>
</h3>
				<p>Like JSON, <code>{}</code> is for constructing objects (aka
dictionaries or hashes), as in: <code>{&quot;a&quot;: 42, &quot;b&quot;: 17}</code>.</p>
<p>If the keys are &quot;sensible&quot; (all alphabetic characters), then
the quotes can be left off. The value can be any expression
(although you may need to wrap it in parentheses if it&#39;s a
complicated one), which gets applied to the {} expression&#39;s
input (remember, all filters have an input and an
output).</p>
<pre><code class="lang-jsq">{foo: .bar}</code></pre>
<p>will produce the JSON object <code>{&quot;foo&quot;: 42}</code> if given the JSON
object <code>{&quot;bar&quot;:42, &quot;baz&quot;:43}</code>. You can use this to select
particular fields of an object: if the input is an object
with &quot;user&quot;, &quot;title&quot;, &quot;id&quot;, and &quot;content&quot; fields and you
just want &quot;user&quot; and &quot;title&quot;, you can write</p>
<pre><code class="lang-jsq">{user: .user, title: .title}</code></pre>
<p>Because that&#39;s so common, there&#39;s a shortcut syntax: <code>{user, title}</code>.</p>
<p>If one of the expressions produces multiple results,
multiple dictionaries will be produced. If the input&#39;s</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">{
  &quot;user&quot;:&quot;tjoekbezoer&quot;,
  &quot;titles&quot;:[&quot;JSQ Primer&quot;, &quot;More JSQ&quot;]
}</code></pre>
<p>then the expression</p>
<pre><code class="lang-jsq">{user, title: .titles[]}</code></pre>
<p>will produce two outputs: </p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">[
  {&quot;user&quot;:&quot;tjoekbezoer&quot;, &quot;title&quot;: &quot;JSQ Primer&quot;},
  {&quot;user&quot;:&quot;tjoekbezoer&quot;, &quot;title&quot;: &quot;More JSQ&quot;}
]</code></pre>
<p>Putting parentheses around the key means it will be evaluated as an
expression. With the same input as above,</p>
<pre><code class="lang-jsq">{(.user): .titles}</code></pre>
<p>produces</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">{&quot;tjoekbezoer&quot;: [&quot;JSQ Primer&quot;, &quot;More JSQ&quot;]}</code></pre>
<p>Simple expressions, like a single filter, can also be used without the parentheses.</p>

			<h2><p>Builtin operators and functions</p>
</h2>
			<p>Some jsq operator (for instance, <code>+</code>) do different things
depending on the type of their arguments (arrays, numbers,
etc.). However, jsq never does implicit type conversions. If you
try to add a string to an object you&#39;ll get an error message and
no result.</p>

			
			<div>
				<h3><p>Addition - <code>+</code></p>
</h3>
				<p>The operator <code>+</code> takes two filters, applies them both
to the same input, and adds the results together. What
&quot;adding&quot; means depends on the types involved:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Numbers</strong> are added by normal arithmetic.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Arrays</strong> are added by being concatenated into a larger array.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Strings</strong> are added by being joined into a larger string.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Objects</strong> are added by merging, that is, inserting all
  the key-value pairs from both objects into a single
  combined object. If both objects contain a value for the
  same key, the object on the right of the <code>+</code> wins.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><code>null</code> can be added to any value, and returns the other
value unchanged.</p>

			</div>
			<div>
				<h3><p>Subtraction - <code>-</code></p>
</h3>
				<p>As well as normal arithmetic subtraction on numbers, the <code>-</code>
operator can be used on arrays to remove all occurences of
the second array&#39;s elements from the first array.</p>

			</div>
			<div>
				<h3><p>Multiplication, division - <code>*</code> and <code>/</code></p>
</h3>
				<p>These operators only work on numbers, and do the expected.</p>

			</div>
			<div>
				<h3><p><code>length</code></p>
</h3>
				<p>The builtin function <code>length</code> gets the length of various
different types of value:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The length of a <strong>string</strong> is the number of Unicode
codepoints it contains (which will be the same as its
JSON-encoded length in bytes if it&#39;s pure ASCII).</p>
</li>
<li><p>The length of an <strong>array</strong> is the number of elements.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The length of an <strong>object</strong> is the number of key-value pairs.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The length of <strong>null</strong> is zero.</p>
</li>
</ul>

			</div>
			<div>
				<h3><p><code>keys</code></p>
</h3>
				<p>The builtin function <code>keys</code>, when given an object, returns its keys
in a list. When given an array, it returns the valid indices  for that
array: the integers from 0 to length-1.</p>
<p>When &#39;keying&#39; an object, do not rely on the sort order. The order in which the
keys are returned is defined by the browser implementation of object iteration,
which is not cross-browser consistent.</p>

			</div>
			<div>
				<h3><p><code>pairs</code></p>
</h3>
				<p>When passed an object, <code>pairs</code> will return a list of arrays, where every array
is a key-value combination. This also works on arrays.</p>
<p>Like with the <code>keys</code> function, do not rely on sort order when &#39;pairing&#39; an object.</p>

			</div>
			<div>
				<h3><p><code>select</code></p>
</h3>
				<p>The function <code>select(foo)</code> produces its input unchanged if
<code>foo</code> returns true for that input, and produces no output
otherwise.</p>
<p>It&#39;s useful for filtering lists, objects and arrays: <code>[1,2,3] | map(select(. &gt;= 2))</code>
will give you <code>[2,3]</code>.</p>

			</div>
			<div>
				<h3><p><code>empty</code></p>
</h3>
				<p><code>empty</code> returns no results. None at all. Not even <code>null</code>.</p>
<p>It&#39;s useful on occasion. You&#39;ll know if you need it :)</p>

			</div>
			<div>
				<h3><p><code>map(x)</code></p>
</h3>
				<p>For any filter <code>x</code>, <code>map(x)</code> will run that filter for each element of the input
object/array, and produce a list of results equal to the amount of elements.
<code>map(.+1)</code> will increment each element of an array of numbers.</p>
<p><code>map(x)</code> is equivalent to <code>.[] | x</code>.</p>

			</div>
			<div>
				<h3><p><code>add</code></p>
</h3>
				<p>The filter <code>add</code> takes as input an array, and produces as
output the elements of the array added together. This might
mean summed, concatenated or merged depending on the types
of the elements of the input array - the rules are the same
as those for the <code>+</code> operator (described above).</p>
<p>If the input is an empty array, <code>add</code> returns <code>null</code>.</p>

			</div>
			<div>
				<h3><p><code>min</code>, <code>max</code></p>
</h3>
				<p>Find the minimum or maximum element of the input array. Providing a filter as argument
allows you to specify a particular field or property to examine, e.g. <code>min(.foo)</code>
finds the object with the smallest <code>foo</code> field.</p>

			</div>
			<div>
				<h3><p><code>recurse</code></p>
</h3>
				<p>The <code>recurse</code> function allows you to search through a
recursive structure, and extract interesting data from all
levels. Suppose your input represents a filesystem:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">{&quot;name&quot;: &quot;/&quot;, &quot;children&quot;: [
  {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;/bin&quot;, &quot;children&quot;: [
    {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;/bin/ls&quot;, &quot;children&quot;: []},
    {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;/bin/sh&quot;, &quot;children&quot;: []}
  ]},
  {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;/home&quot;, &quot;children&quot;: [
    {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;/home/daan&quot;, &quot;children&quot;: [
      {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;/home/daan/jsq&quot;, &quot;children&quot;: []}
    ]}
  ]}
]}</code></pre>
<p>Now suppose you want to extract all of the filenames
present. You need to retrieve <code>.name</code>, <code>.children[].name</code>,
<code>.children[].children[].name</code>, and so on. You can do this
with:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-jsq">recurse(.children[]) | .name</code></pre>

			</div>
			<div>
				<h3><p><code>format(string)</code></p>
</h3>
				<p>Much like a simplified sprintf, <code>format</code> accepts an array of values to be integrated
into a custom string.</p>

			</div>
			
			<hr/>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2><p>Conditionals and Comparisons</p>
</h2>
			
			
			<div>
				<h3><p><code>==</code>, <code>===</code>, <code>!=</code></p>
</h3>
				<p>The expression &#39;a == b&#39; will produce &#39;true&#39; if the result of a and b
are equal (that is, if they represent equivalent JSON documents) and
&#39;false&#39; otherwise. In particular, strings are never considered equal
to numbers. If you&#39;re coming from Javascript, jsq&#39;s == is like
Javascript&#39;s === - considering values equal only when they have the
same type as well as the same value.</p>
<p>!= is &quot;not equal&quot;, and &#39;a != b&#39; returns the opposite value of &#39;a == b&#39;</p>

			</div>
			<div>
				<h3><p><code>&gt;</code>, <code>&gt;=</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>, <code>&lt;</code></p>
</h3>
				<p>The comparison operators <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&gt;=</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>, <code>&lt;</code> return whether
their left argument is greater than, greater than or equal
to, less than or equal to or less than their right argument
(respectively).</p>
<p>The ordering is the same as that described for <code>sort</code>, above.</p>

			</div>
			<div>
				<h3><p>if(cond, then[, else])</p>
</h3>
				<p><code>if(A, B, C)</code> will execute <code>B</code> if <code>A</code> evaluates as truthy, otherwise it will optionally
execute <code>C</code>.</p>
<p>Checking for false or null is a simpler notion of
&quot;truthiness&quot; than is found in Javascript or Python, but it
means that you&#39;ll sometimes have to be more explicit about
the condition you want: you can&#39;t test whether, e.g. a
string is empty using <code>if .name then A else B end</code>, you&#39;ll
need something more like <code>if (.name | count) &gt; 0 then A else
B end</code> instead.</p>
<p>If the condition A produces multiple results, it is
considered &quot;true&quot; if any of those results is not false or
null. If it produces zero results, it&#39;s considered false.</p>
<p>More cases can be added to an if using <code>elif A then B</code> syntax.</p>

			</div>
			<div>
				<h3><p><code>&amp;&amp;</code>, <code>||</code></p>
</h3>
				<p>jsq supports the normal Boolean operators and/or/not. They have the
same standard of truth as if expressions - false and null are
considered &quot;false values&quot;, and anything else is a &quot;true value&quot;.</p>
<p>If an operand of one of these operators produces multiple
results, the operator itself will produce a result for each input.</p>
<p><code>not</code> is in fact a builtin function rather than an operator,
so it is called as a filter to which things can be piped
rather than with special syntax, as in <code>.foo and .bar |
not</code>.</p>
<p>These three only produce the values &quot;true&quot; and &quot;false&quot;, and
so are only useful for genuine Boolean operations, rather
than the common Perl/Python/Ruby idiom of
&quot;value_that_may_be_null or default&quot;. If you want to use this
form of &quot;or&quot;, picking between two values rather than
evaluating a condition, see the &quot;//&quot; operator below.</p>

			<h2><p>Advanced features</p>
</h2>
			<p>Variables are an absolute necessity in most programming languages, but
they&#39;re relegated to an &quot;advanced feature&quot; in jsq.</p>
<p>In most languages, variables are the only means of passing around
data. If you calculate a value, and you want to use it more than once,
you&#39;ll need to store it in a variable. To pass a value to another part
of the program, you&#39;ll need that part of the program to define a
variable (as a function parameter, object member, or whatever) in
which to place the data.</p>

			
			<div>
				<h3><p>Variables</p>
</h3>
				<p>In jsq, all filters have an input and an output, so manual
plumbing is not necessary to pass a value from one part of a program
to the next. Many expressions, for instance <code>a + b</code>, pass their input
to two distinct subexpressions (here <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are both passed the
same input), so variables aren&#39;t usually necessary in order to use a
value twice.</p>
<p>For instance, calculating the average value of an array of numbers
requires a few variables in most languages - at least one to hold the
array, perhaps one for each element or for a loop counter. In jsq, it&#39;s
simply <code>add / length</code> - the <code>add</code> expression is given the array and
produces its sum, and the <code>length</code> expression is given the array and
produces its length.</p>
<p>So, there&#39;s generally a cleaner way to solve most problems in jsq that
defining variables. Still, sometimes they do make things easier, so jsq
lets you define variables using <code>expression as $variable</code>. All
variable names start with <code>$</code>. Here&#39;s a slightly uglier version of the
array-averaging example:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-jsq">length as $array_length | add / $array_length</code></pre>
<p>We&#39;ll need a more complicated problem to find a situation where using
variables actually makes our lives easier.</p>
<p>Suppose we have an array of blog posts, with &quot;author&quot; and &quot;title&quot;
fields, and another object which is used to map author usernames to
real names. Our input looks like:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">{
  &quot;posts&quot;: [
    {&quot;title&quot;: &quot;Frist psot&quot;, &quot;author&quot;: &quot;anon&quot;},
    {&quot;title&quot;: &quot;A well-written article&quot;, &quot;author&quot;: &quot;person1&quot;}],
  &quot;realnames&quot;: {
    &quot;anon&quot;: &quot;Anonymous Coward&quot;,
    &quot;person1&quot;: &quot;Person McPherson&quot;
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>We want to produce the posts with the author field containing a real
name, as in:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">[
  {&quot;title&quot;: &quot;Frist psot&quot;, &quot;author&quot;: &quot;Anonymous Coward&quot;},
  {&quot;title&quot;: &quot;A well-written article&quot;, &quot;author&quot;: &quot;Person McPherson&quot;}
]</code></pre>
<p>We use a variable, $names, to store the realnames object, so that we
can refer to it later when looking up author usernames:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-jsq">.realnames as $names | .posts[] | {title, author: $names[.author]}</code></pre>
<p>The expression &quot;foo as $x&quot; runs foo, puts the result in $x,
and returns the original input. Apart from the side-effect
of binding the variable, it has the same effect as &quot;.&quot;.</p>

			</div>

			<h2><p>Assignment</p>
</h2>
			<p>Assignment works a little differently in jsq than in most
programming languages. jsq doesn&#39;t distinguish between references
to and copies of something - two objects or arrays are either
equal or not equal, without any further notion of being &quot;the
same object&quot; or &quot;not the same object&quot;.</p>
<p>If an object has two fields which are arrays, <code>.foo</code> and <code>.bar</code>,
and you append something to <code>.foo</code>, then <code>.bar</code> will not get
bigger. Even if you&#39;ve just set <code>.bar = .foo</code>. If you&#39;re used to
programming in languages like Python, Java, Ruby, Javascript,
etc. then you can think of it as though jsq does a full deep copy
of every object before it does the assignment (for performance,
it doesn&#39;t actually do that, but that&#39;s the general idea).</p>

			
			<div>
				<h3><p><code>=</code></p>
</h3>
				<p>The filter <code>.foo = 1</code> will take as input an object
and produce as output an object with the &quot;foo&quot; field set to
1. There is no notion of &quot;modifying&quot; or &quot;changing&quot; something
in jsq - all jsq values are immutable. For instance,</p>
<pre><code class="lang-jsq">.foo = .bar | .foo.baz = 1</code></pre>
<p>will not have the side-effect of setting .bar.baz to be set
to 1, as the similar-looking program in Javascript, Python,
Ruby or other languages would. Unlike these languages (but
like Haskell and some other functional languages), there is
no notion of two arrays or objects being &quot;the same array&quot; or
&quot;the same object&quot;. They can be equal, or not equal, but if
we change one of them in no circumstances will the other
change behind our backs.</p>
<p>This means that it&#39;s impossible to build circular values in
jsq (such as an array whose first element is itself). This is
quite intentional, and ensures that anything a jsq program
can produce can be represented in JSON.</p>

			</div>
			<div>
				<h3><p><code>|=</code></p>
</h3>
				<p>As well as the assignment operator &#39;=&#39;, jsq provides the &quot;update&quot;
operator &#39;|=&#39;, which takes a filter on the right-hand side and
works out the new value for the property being assigned to by running
the old value through this expression. For instance, .foo |= .+1 will
build an object with the &quot;foo&quot; field set to the input&#39;s &quot;foo&quot; plus 1.</p>
<p>This example should show the difference between &#39;=&#39; and &#39;|=&#39;. Provide input</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">{&quot;a&quot;: {&quot;b&quot;: 10}, &quot;b&quot;: 20}</code></pre>
<p>to the programs <code>.a = .b</code> and <code>.a |= .b</code></p>
<p>The former will set the &quot;a&quot; field of the input to the &quot;b&quot; field of the
input, and produce the output {&quot;a&quot;: 20}. The latter will set the &quot;a&quot;
field of the input to the &quot;a&quot; field&#39;s &quot;b&quot; field, producing {&quot;a&quot;: 10}.</p>

			</div>
			<div>
				<h3><p><code>+=</code>, <code>-=</code>, <code>*=</code>, <code>/=</code></p>
</h3>
				<p>jsq has a few operators of the form <code>a op= b</code>, which are all
equivalent to <code>a |= . op b</code>. So, <code>+= 1</code> can be used to increment values.</p>

			</div>
			<div>
				<h3><p>Complex assignments</p>
</h3>
				<p>Lots more things are allowed on the left-hand side of a jsq assignment
than in most langauges. We&#39;ve already seen simple field accesses on
the left hand side, and it&#39;s no surprise that array accesses work just
as well:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-jsq">.posts[0].title = &quot;JSQ Manual&quot;</code></pre>
<p>What may come as a surprise is that the expression on the left may
produce multiple results, referring to different points in the input
document:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-jsq">.posts[].comments |= . + [&quot;this is great&quot;]</code></pre>
<p>That example appends the string &quot;this is great&quot; to the &quot;comments&quot;
array of each post in the input (where the input is an object with a
field &quot;posts&quot; which is an array of posts).</p>
<p>When jsq encounters an assignment like &#39;a = b&#39;, it records the &quot;path&quot;
taken to select a part of the input document while executing a. This
path is then used to find which part of the input to change while
executing the assignment. Any filter may be used on the
left-hand side of an equals - whichever paths it selects from the
input will be where the assignment is performed.</p>
<p>This is a very powerful operation. Suppose we wanted to add a comment
to blog posts, using the same &quot;blog&quot; input above. This time, we only
want to comment on the posts written by &quot;tjoekbezoer&quot;. We can find those
posts using the &quot;select&quot; function described earlier:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-jsq">.posts[] | select(.author == &quot;tjoekbezoer&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>The paths provided by this operation point to each of the posts that
&quot;tjoekbezoer&quot; wrote, and we can comment on each of them in the same way
that we did before:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-jsq">(.posts[] | select(.author == &quot;tjoekbezoer&quot;) | .comments) |= . + [&quot;terrible.&quot;]</code></pre>
